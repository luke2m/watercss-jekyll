# Water.css Jekyll theme (Work in Progress)

This is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages with simple styling from [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev)
## Installation

Add this line to your `_config.yml` (only on GitHub Pages). You can also fork or download this repo and host it wherever you want. A Ruby Gem will be published once this is more complete.

```yaml
remote-theme: "luke2m/watercss-jekyll@main"
```

## Usage

This theme is meant for quick repo docs, not blogs or personal sites. I may make a theme for that purpose sometime soon. 
Configurable variables (in `_config.yml`):
- Light, Dark, or Automatic theme
- Title and description
- Show or hide download and source links
- Change View on GitHub to another name
- Change download link
- Add privacy friendly analytics with [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com)
- More customization will be coming soon.
