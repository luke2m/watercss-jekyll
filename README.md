# Water.css Jekyll theme

This is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages with simple styling from [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev)
## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` (only on GitHub Pages)

```yaml
remote-theme: "luke2m/watercss-jekyll@main"
```

## Usage

This theme is meant for quick repo docs, not blogs. 
Configurable variables:
The theme is automatic by default, but you can change it to force dark or light by changing the css variable in _config.yml
More customization will be coming soon.
